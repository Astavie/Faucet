    p Co-creator cappinkanga broke the fourth wall earlier today, to much confusion. One user, maximusmondelius commented: “Isn’t this a bit self-serving?” While another, more favourable review from mennosaurus007 described it as “a bit fun.”
    p But questions have arisen; will cappinkanga do this again?
    p No
