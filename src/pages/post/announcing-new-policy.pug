    p I have listened to my constituents, and plan to target this inactivity crisis head-on. Numerous decent, good-natured, people have come to me complaining of the threat that is laziness. With this speech, I declare war on laziness. In our first metaphorical battle against this very literal monster, we will begin banning the use of social media in the workplace. Remember, every minute spent scrolling is a minute not spent succeeding! Now, I have work to do.
